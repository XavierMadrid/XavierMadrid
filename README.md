- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XavierMadrid

I'm a student at University of California, Riverside majoring in pure mathematics and minoring in computer science. If I'm not swamped with work from my classes or researching mathematics, I'm probably programming (or playing) games. On my Github you can find the largest game I've worked on to date (unfortunately unfinished). You can also find some code in the language Macaulay2 that I wrote for my mathematics research project. You can run it in the [Macaulay2 editor](https://www.unimelb-macaulay2.cloud.edu.au/#editor). Simply choose an acyclic directed graph and using the package ThinSincereQuivers, it outputs the vertices of the associated polytope. You can learn more about this polytope and the background behind my research through the papers: [Hille 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379502004068) and [Domokos 2014](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1402.5096).
