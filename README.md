- 👋 Hi, I’m @XavierMadrid
- 👀 I’m interested in ... computer science and being a future programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to code through Unity and through making small games. I like it so far, but it's hard to balance this and doing schoolwork. :(
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... xaviermadrid04@gmail.com
